Let’s say we have a website and we keep track of what pages customers are viewing, for things like business metrics.
* Every time somebody comes to the website, we write a record to a log file consisting of Timestamp, PageId, CustomerId. At the end of the day we have a big log file with many entries in that format. And for every day we have a new file.
* Now, given two log files (log file from day 1 and log file from day 2) we want to generate a list of ‘loyal customers’ that meet the criteria of: (a) they came on both days, and (b) they visited at least two unique pages.
